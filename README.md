# Credit-Fraud-Detection-System
This project builds a Credit Card Fraud Detection System using Machine Learning. It preprocesses transaction data, handles class imbalance and trains a Random Forest model to detect fraudulent transactions. It includes a CSV-based prediction system that predicts and reports fraud probabilities for new transaction data accurately.
